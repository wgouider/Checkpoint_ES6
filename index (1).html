    <p>
      ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript.
      In 2012, the modern browser started supporting ECMAScript 5.1. However, as
      of 2015, all browsers had started using the newest implementation
      ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6 or ES6). It allows you to write less code
      and do more.
